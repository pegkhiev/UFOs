# UFOs

## Background
The challenge is to create an interactive table that allows user to filter 5 different parameters: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings, making use of javascript and html to display the result. 

## Homepage 

The final output is a homepage that allows users to enter their chosen date, city, state, and country, and a dropdown menu is used for users to select the shape of the UFOs (as there are diverse shapes and not necessarily familiar to users). 

The homepage allows users to either filter all five fields, or any number of filters. In the screenshot below the output table is filtered by state (FL) and shape (FIREBALL).
