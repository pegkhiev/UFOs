# UFOs

## Background
The challenge is to create a homepage that includes a short article, a table to display a dataset of UFO sightings, and interactive functionality that allows user to filter 5 different parameters: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings. 

## Technology Used 
- html
- Javascript 
- Bootstrap 
- CSS level 3

## Homepage 

The final output is a homepage that allows users to enter their chosen date, city, state, and country, and a dropdown menu is used for users to select the shape of the UFOs (as there are diverse shapes and not necessarily familiar to users). 

The homepage allows users to either filter all five fields, or any number of filters. In the screenshot below the output table is filtered by state (FL) and shape (FIREBALL).

## Recommendation for Further Development 
To make it more interactive for users, we can further develop the table so that if a user enters a city that is not in the dataset, the nearest city with a sighting will be displayed.
